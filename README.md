# Introduction
Im a Cybersecurity professional who has a deep passion for cybersecurity through hands‑on experience in SOC operations, IT support, vulnerability remediation, and system administration. My work across enterprise environments solidified my interest in threat detection, incident response, and defensive security practices.

## Objective
My journey across IT support, system administration, and SOC analysis roles strengthened my ability to investigate threats, analyze logs, and protect enterprise systems. I was now looking to transition fully into a dedicated Security Operations Center (SOC) role as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst, where I could apply my analytical skills, technical foundation, and real‑world experience to help secure critical systems and improve detection capabilities
